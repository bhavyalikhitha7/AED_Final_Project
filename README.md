# üöÄEcoFood Connect

## üìò **Project Overview**
EcoFood Connect is a **Java Swing-based software platform** designed to tackle the issue of food wastage and hunger in the United States. With over **133 billion pounds of food wasted annually**, the platform aims to streamline the process of donating surplus food from restaurants to food banks, managing the logistics of food donations, and ensuring the sustainable disposal of non-edible food waste.

This ecosystem facilitates the collaboration between four key entities ‚Äî **Restaurants**, **Food Banks**, **Logistics Providers**, and **Waste Management Firms** ‚Äî to create an efficient process for redistributing surplus food to those in need while minimizing environmental impact.

---

## üîç **Problem Statement**
- The U.S. generates significant food waste, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and hunger.
- Restaurants, being one of the largest food producers, lack a unified platform to donate surplus food efficiently.
- There is a disconnect between stakeholders (restaurants, food banks, logistics, waste management) in managing food surplus and waste.

---

## üí° **Solution**
EcoFood Connect provides an end-to-end platform connecting restaurants, food banks, logistics companies, and waste management firms. The system allows:

- **Easy coordination** between donors (restaurants) and recipients (food banks).
- **Efficient management** of logistics for food delivery.
- **Sustainable disposal** of non-edible food waste.

### üîë **Key Features**
- **Coordination**: Seamless communication between all stakeholders.
- **Efficiency**: Simplifies the donation process and waste management.
- **Impact Tracking**: Reports metrics such as food donated, waste reduced, and carbon emissions prevented.

## üåê **Ecosystem Components**
1. **Network**: Centralized communication system for all stakeholders.
2. **Enterprises**: 
   - **Restaurants**: Initiate donation requests for surplus food.
   - **Food Banks**: Receive and redistribute donated food.
   - **Logistics Providers**: Transport food donations.
   - **Waste Management Firms**: Process non-edible food waste.
3. **Organizations**:
   - **Donation Management**
   - **Logistics and Delivery**
   - **Quality Assurance**
   - **Waste Processing**
   - **Reporting and Analytics**
4. **Roles**:
   - **System Admin**
   - **Enterprise Admin**
   - **Restaurant Manager**
   - **Logistics Coordinator**
   - **Food Bank Manager**
   - **Quality Inspector**
   - **Waste Management Operator**
   - **End Users** (Shelter Recipients)

## üìã **Use Cases**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Food Donation Request**
1. A restaurant creates a donation request with food type, quantity, and pickup time.
2. The Food Bank Manager approves or rejects the request.
3. Logistics assigns a driver for pickup, and the food is delivered to a shelter.
4. The request is tagged as "Completed" in the system.

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Cross-Enterprise Collaboration**
1. Multiple food chains contribute surplus to a mega food bank.
2. The admin monitors cross-enterprise collaboration, and logistics handles multi-point pickups.

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Waste Treatment**
1. Restaurants report non-edible waste.
2. Waste management operators process and update the system with environmental impact data.

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Reporting**
1. The System Administrator generates reports detailing:
   - Total food donations
   - Carbon emissions reduced
   - Cross-enterprise collaboration

---

## üéØ **Deliverables**
1. **A working Java Swing application** that implements the EcoFood Connect ecosystem.
2. **A presentation** outlining the design, implementation, and problem-solving approach.
3. **Role-based authentication** with username and password capabilities.
4. **Reporting module** providing a summarized view of system performance.
5. **Configuration module** with test cases to validate the system's correctness.

---

## ‚ú® **Features Implemented**

- **Network Management**: Facilitates communication among all stakeholders.
